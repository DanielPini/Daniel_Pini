      <p class="blurb">
        BEING came out of a love of contemporary Australian classical music and
        the desire to share the music of my home country with the people the
        world over. The album is made of five works from living Australian
        composers for solo cello. Each piece builds its own world of sound, and
        despite all coming from Australian composers and composed within the
        past 30 years, each is distinct and speaks to the diverse voices in
        Australian composition. <br /><br />My hope is that, through sharing
        this album, more people can come to know and love Australian music.
        <br /><br />My thanks go to the composers Victoria Pham, Brett Dean,
        Deborah Cheetham Fraillon, Liza Lim, and Carl Vine, to Move records, for
        helping me to record this project, to Genevieve Fry for creating the art
        for this album, to Creative Australia for supporting BEING, and for all
        the wonderful people who helped me during this process.
